# Examples

An overview of the examples included with SwiftCrossUI.

## Overview

A few examples are included with SwiftCrossUI to demonstrate some of it's basic features. These examples are:

- `CounterExample`, a simple app with buttons to increase and decrease a count.

- `RandomNumberGeneratorExample`, a simple app to generate random numbers between a minimum and maximum.

- `WindowPropertiesExample`, a simple app used to demonstrate some of the available window properties. See ``WindowProperties`` for more information.

To run an example, either select the example under schemes at the top of the window (in Xcode), or run one of the following commands (if using a terminal):
```
swift run CounterExample

swift run RandomNumberGeneratorExample

swift run WindowPropertiesExample
```
