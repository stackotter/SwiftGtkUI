# ``SwiftCrossUI``

Create cross-platform desktop apps for macOS, Linux and Windows.

## Overview

SwiftCrossUI implements a simple API similar but not identical to SwiftUI, allowing you to use the basic concepts of SwiftUI to create a cross-platofrm desktop app. SwiftCrossUI is designed to be flexible and can work with different backends, but has a focus on using GTK+ through SwiftGTK.
